<p>Curious about which champions you've earned Hextech chests on? Check it here!</p>

<p>Just enter your summoner name, and hit the refresh button. The list will show all the champions you've played and the champions you've earned a chest on will have a light blue border. You can also filter the champs to just see champs you've earned chests on, and champs you still need to earn chests on so you can see who to play next. Also, the champions are sorted by highest champ mastery level to lowest, so you'll see who you're more likely to get an S with next!</p>

<p>Your summoner name is only used to request information from Riot using Riot APIs. It is only stored on your local device so you don't have to reinput your summoner name on subsequent uses.</p>
